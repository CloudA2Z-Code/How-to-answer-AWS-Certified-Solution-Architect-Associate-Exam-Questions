Question 2:
==========
Your company requires that S3 objects should be replicated in different AWS regions. You have an S3 bucket in the ap-southeast-1 region and its objects are encrypted with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). How would you configure the Cross-Region replication (CRR) for the encrypted objects in the S3 bucket?

Answer:
=======

1 - What (Observations - Understand the question)
================================================
Used AWS technologies 
---------------------
* AWS S3
* AWS KMS

Questions/Pain areas highlighted
--------------------------------
* Encrypted with KMS
* CRR for encrypted objects possible or not


2 - How (How well this scenario can be architected, which AWS services can help)
================================================================================
* Scripts or Lambda to replicate
* S3
* KMS


3 - Why (Analyse the AWS services capability)
=============================================
Service Capabilities:
---------------------
* SSE-KMS enables you to use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to manage your encryption keys. Using AWS KMS to manage your keys provides several additional benefits. With AWS KMS, there are separate permissions for the use of the master key, providing an additional layer of control as well as protection against unauthorized access to your objects stored in Amazon S3. AWS KMS provides an audit trail so you can see who used your key to access which object and when, as well as view failed attempts to access data from users without permission to decrypt the data.

* CRR is an Amazon S3 feature that automatically replicates data between buckets across different AWS Regions. With CRR, you can set up replication at a bucket level, a shared prefix level, or an object level using S3 object tags. You can use CRR to provide lower-latency data access in different geographic regions. CRR can also help if you have a compliance requirement to store copies of data hundreds of miles apart. 

Compatibility:
-------------
Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances

Scenarios you can use:
----------------------
1) Asynchrnous copying
2) Post Processing in another region(replicating files in a bucket in 1 region to another in different region)
3) Replication of Encrypted objects in S3 is limited only to object encrypted by SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS managed keys. SSE-C are ignored.
4) CRR works for only Buckets in diff AWS regions and versining enabled.

Considerations:
---------------
1) Pricing - 
Cross-region replication incurs request and transfer fees of $0.005/1000 requests and $0.02/1GB transferred. Standard storage pricing on the replicated side apply and differ by region.  Currently for US locations N. California is 10-60% more expensive than N. Virginia and Oregon, depending on S3, S3-IA, or Glacier.

  For an example, replicating 2500GB data containing 5000files breaks down as follows:

  5 * $0.005 + 2500 * $0.02 = $50.025 access & transfer fees

  DATA transfer in S3 - There is no Data Transfer charge for data transferred within an Amazon S3 Region via a COPY request. Data transferred via a COPY request between AWS Regions is charged at rates specified in the pricing section of the Amazon S3 detail page.

2) Latency - Delay
